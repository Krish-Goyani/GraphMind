# GraphMind üß†

GraphMind is an intelligent knowledge graph assistant that combines the power of Large Language Models with graph-based information retrieval as well as traditional unstructured information retrieval. It processes YouTube content into a structured knowledge graph along with text chunks and provides contextually aware responses to user queries.


## üåü Features

- **YouTube Content Processing**: Automatically extracts and processes transcripts from YouTube videos
- **Knowledge Graph Generation**: Creates a structured Neo4j graph database from processed content
- **Intelligent RAG**: Implements Hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation for accurate responses
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Maintains conversation context for more relevant answers
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: User-friendly Streamlit interface for easy interaction

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Neo4j Database
- Google AI API Key
- Groq API Key

### Installation
